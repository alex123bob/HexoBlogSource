This morning, I shopped in local supermarket, buying two bags of Cheetos. I simply wanna do a testing on them coz they belong to flaming hot cheetos' category which is not available in China. 
I've always been curious about its flavour and taste. Therefore I have my first tiral on flaming hot crunchy cheetos to get the answer.

##### **Danger!!!**
There are tons of tons of ppl on social media like YouTuBe trying this one, and some even gives warning on not having it coz it's inflammable. They even light a single piece up.
Oopsie, sooooo horrible. So I decide to eat it anyway :).

##### **Enough talk**
Let's get down to the business right now.

* Flavour
When I take the first bite, I can barely feel its spiciness. What comes in the first place is more like the flavour of green curry and a little bit sourness. But curry-like flavour takes the majority.
After couple of seconds, I can taste its spiciness, saltiness, and a taste of mixed fragrant spices.
Maybe my tolerance of spiciness is better than the average, I don't feel uncomfortable after eating half the bag(May my butt will give a disapproval on what I am saying next morning in bathroom.)
Btw, my finger is turned into red, especially the sides of my fingernails, look extremely <font color="red"><strong>`HOT`</strong></font>.

* Crunchiness
Yea, it's very crunchy.

* Size
It'll be better if only the size of each piece is bigger than that.

### **Long story short**
I LIKE IT. ^_^
